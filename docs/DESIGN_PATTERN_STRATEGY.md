Shopify Design Pattern Strategy for AvelleThis document outlines the specific user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) patterns recommended for the Avelle Shopify storefront. These patterns are derived from a comparative analysis of Duma Official and Cloxvox, tailored to meet the needs of a modern femininity and lifestyle-focused fashion brand.1. Homepage: The Brand Narrative & DiscoveryThe homepage serves as the primary entry point for brand storytelling. It should balance high-impact visuals with clear pathways to product categories.Hero Section (Slideshow): Use a full-width rotating slideshow of high-resolution banners to promote seasonal drops or sales (e.g., "New Arrivals" or "Holiday Sale"). Implement a "Mobile Big Banner" to ensure visual impact is maintained on smaller screens.Category Grid: Directly below the hero, use a structured grid (e.g., 2x2 or 4 blocks) for main categories like Tops, Bottoms, and Dresses with clear "Shop Now" call-to-action (CTA) buttons."Steal the Look" Module: Integrate an interactive section featuring lifestyle/editorial imagery where users can view an outfit and immediately shop individual items (e.g., matching bags or accessories) featured in that look.Social Proof (Instagram Feed): Include a "From Our Feed" section that pulls real-world photos from the @withavelle account to foster community connection and authenticity.Persistent Support: A floating WhatsApp icon should be visible on all pages to provide instant customer service, a critical feature for Southeast Asian markets.2. Collection Page: Structured BrowsingThe collection page (PLP) must handle the catalog efficiently while providing tools to narrow down choices.Visual Grid & Hover Effects: Utilize a responsive grid layout. Implement an "alternate imagery" hover effect where the product image changes to a different angle (e.g., back view or fabric detail) when moused over.Badges & Status Indicators: Use clear visual overlays for:"Sold Out": Clearly mark unavailable items."On Sale": Use strikethrough pricing (e.g., ~~Rp 379.000~~ Rp 189.500) to highlight discounts."Back in Stock" / "New": Highlight returning favorites or fresh drops.Advanced Filtering Sidebar:By Attribute: Allow filtering by material (Knit vs. Woven), size (e.g., S, M, L, Allsize), and stock status (Preorder vs. Readystock).Attribute-Specific Navigation: For products with specific technical traits (like heel height in footwear), provide specialized filters.Sorting Logic: Provide a dropdown menu at the top for "Best Selling," "Newest Arrivals," and "Price (Low to High/High to Low)".3. Product Detail Page (PDP): Conversion & TrustThe PDP is where technical details meet aspirational imagery to close the sale.Dynamic Size Selection & Guide:Unique Size Charts: Avoid universal charts; provide specific measurements (Bust, Waist, Length) for each unique design in the description.Model Stats: List the height and size of the model in the photos to provide scale.Stock Scarcity Warnings: Implement real-time alerts like "Only 1 piece in stock!" or "Limited Stock Available" to create a psychological nudge for immediate purchase.Trust Signals: Place icons directly near the "Add to Cart" button for "Easy & Secure Payment," "7-Day Exchange," and "Proudly Made in Indonesia" (or relevant origin).Quick Add/Shop Module: Ensure a "Featured Product" module is available on the homepage or in editorial blocks that allows users to select a size and add to cart without navigating away.4. Cart & Checkout Flow: Frictionless TransactionsA "Cart Drawer" (mini-cart) is the preferred pattern to keep users in the shopping flow.Cart Drawer Functionality: When a product is added, a side panel should slide out rather than redirecting to a full cart page.Progressive Rewards: Include a free shipping progress bar (e.g., "You're Rp 150.000 away from Free Shipping!") to increase Average Order Value (AOV).Navigation in Cart: Provide two clear buttons at the bottom of the drawer: "View Cart" (secondary) and "Checkout" (primary/bold).Cross-Sells: Suggest 1-2 compatible add-ons (e.g., a "Complete the Look" suggestion) directly inside the drawer.5. Mandatory Pages & Shopify FieldsTo build credibility and comply with local regulations, the following pages and fields must be present:Page TypeEssential Content PatternsAbout UsFocus on brand philosophy (e.g., "Simple but Significant") and community-driven storytelling.Shipping InformationExplicitly state origin (Jakarta), processing times (1-5 days), and regional delivery timelines (7-14 days for international).Return & ExchangesDefine a 7-day window, condition requirements (unworn), and handling fees (e.g., IDR 10.000).FAQCategorized sections for "Order Status," "Sizing," and "Product Care" (e.g., how to clean delicate fabrics).Contact UsStructured web form with fields for Name, Email, Phone (optional), and Message.Privacy Policy & TermsMandatory legal disclosures regarding data usage and commercial relationship.Functional Checkout FieldsLocalized Address Fields: Use specific Shopify apps to optimize address entry for Indonesian and Singaporean shoppers, ensuring accurate district and postal code selection to reduce abandoned carts.Currency Switcher: A persistent utility in the header/footer to toggle between IDR (local) and USD (international).
